Here we have a few modified files that should be added to our installed web2py, typically overwriting an existing file of the same name.

See the comments in each file for a description of these changes and the need for each.

Maintenance notes:

* These patch files should always track the currently deployed version of web2py
* If you modify the filenames, add / remove files, update the loop in the two "Copy web2py * patch file" tasks in `roles/webapp/tasks/main.yml`
